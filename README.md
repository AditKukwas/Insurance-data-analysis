# Insurance Data Analysis

Conducted an analysis on Insurance data from the perspective of insurance provider and created interactive dashboard using Excel, MySQL and Power BI.

**The objectives of the project were:**
1. Finding No of Invoice by Account Executive.
2. Finding Yearly Meeting Count.
3. Finding Target Revenue, Achieved Revenue and Invoice revenue for Cross Sell contracts, new contracts and renewal contracts.
4. Finding No of meeting By Account Executive.
5. Finding Top Open Opportunity
6. Finding Total Profits by Region.
7. Finding Oppt-Product distribution

The project showcases the use of Excel, SQL, and dashboard tools such as Power BI for data analysis and visualization, and provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about these tools and techniques.

SQL To extract relevant data from the Zomato dataset, SQL queries were executed using the following keywords:

SELECT to retrieve data from specific columns FROM to specify the table to retrieve data from WHERE to filter data based on specific conditions GROUP BY to group data based on specific columns ORDER BY to sort data in ascending or descending order.

Power BI To visualize and analyze the Zomato restaurant data, Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards. The following features and functions were utilized:

Data modeling using relationships between tables and calculated columns Measures and DAX formulas to perform calculations on the data Visualizations such as tables, charts, and maps to display the data Slicers and filters to enable dynamic filtering of the data Drill-through functionality to navigate between different levels of detail in the data

**Insights obtained from this project are:**
1. Analyzing performance of Account Executives provideds insights into the performance of Account Executives by finding the number of invoices generated by each executive. This information can be crucial for evaluating the sales team.
2. The breakdown of target revenue, achieved revenue, and invoice revenue by contract type (Cross Sell, New, Renewal) provides a clear view of the financial performance associated with different contract categories. This can guide strategic decisions and sales focus.
3. Understanding the number of meetings conducted by each Account Executive can help in assessing their engagement levels and workloads.
4. Identifying the top open opportunities is essential for prioritizing sales efforts and potential revenue streams. This insight can guide the sales team in pursuing new prospects.
5. Analyzing total profits by region can help the insurance provider in focusing their resources on regions with higher profitability and identifying areas for potential improvement.
6. The interactive dashboards in Excel and Power BI allow users to explore the data in a user-friendly way. Users can apply filters and drill down into specific aspects of the data to uncover insights tailored to their needs.

Here are the images showcasing the dashboards I have created.
